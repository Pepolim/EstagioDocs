    - Mastery Levels: Percentage of students mastering key skills (basic, intermediate, advanced).
    - Progress Toward Goals: Tracks completion of learning objectives.
    - Skill Gaps: Highlight areas where most students are underperforming.

### 5. Comparative Analytics
- **Class vs. Individual Performance**
    - Class Averages: Compare individual performance against class averages.
    - Benchmarking: Measure performance against school or district standards.

- **Class vs. Class Comparison**
    - Subject Performance: Compare Math scores between Class A and Class B.
    - Teacher Impact: Analyze performance trends under different teachers.

- **Historical Comparisons**
    - Year-over-Year Growth: Grade trends over multiple academic years.
    - Previous Term Analysis: Compare term-wise progression.

### 6. Predictive and Diagnostic Analytics
- **Predictive Models**
    - At-Risk Identification: Predict which students might struggle based on attendance, grades, or behavior.
    - Performance Forecasting: Predict future grades based on current trends.

- **Root Cause Analysis**
    - Performance Correlations: Identify links between low grades and attendance or participation.
    - Assignment Analysis: Pinpoint assignments or quizzes that lead to significant struggles.

### 7. Engagement Metrics
- **Digital Engagement**
    - Platform Usage: Track login frequency and time spent in the app.
    - Interactive Learning Participation: Completion rates for quizzes or gamified learning modules.

- **Feedback Loops**
    - Feedback Received: Number of teacher comments on assignments.
    - Response Rates: How quickly students respond to teacher feedback.

### 8. Visualizations for BI Dashboards
- **Line Charts**: For trends in grades, attendance, and engagement over time.

- **Bar Graphs**: Compare performance across subjects, students, or assignments.

- **Heatmaps**: Attendance patterns or areas of skill mastery.

- **Pie Charts**: Grade distribution or participation categories.

- **Radar Charts**: Skill proficiency comparisons across subjects.

- **Tables with Filters**: Detailed student data with sorting and filtering capabilities.

- **KPIs**: Highlight critical stats like average grade, attendance rate, and overdue tasks on the dashboard header.

### 9. Custom Alerts
